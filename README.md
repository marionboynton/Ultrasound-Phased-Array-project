# Ultrasound-Phased-Array-project


A MATLAB program was created to simulate the ultrasound fields generated by a collection of transmitters when di↵erent phases are applied. This was done by calculating the values of the pressure waves emitted from the seven transmitters at a point and summing them to obtain the total pressure value for that point. This was done for many co-ordinates in the x-y-z space, which were plotted as coloured points with the colour representing the pressure value at that point.

The pressure attenuation due to beam divergence was considered for this simulation. The attenuation due to absorption was not considered as the absorption for ultrasonic waves in the lower frequency range (20 kHz - 100 kHz) when propagating through air over small distances is negligible. The attenuation of 50 kHz ultrasound in air at 20°C and 60% humidity is about 1 dB/m.[20] This corresponds to less than a percent attenuation over the 8 cm distance considered for this experiment. This small attenuation factor would not a↵ect the simulations and was therefore excluded.

Several simulations were generated from this program to observe the various pressure fields being generated by the di↵erent transmitter configurations with the di↵erent delay sequences applied. Examples of plots are included.
